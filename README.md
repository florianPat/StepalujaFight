To build this project, you need the NitroNet libary wich is linked in the repo. 
The java jar for Ipify (https://www.ipify.org/) which you can get here: https://bitbucket.org/stevenjeffries/java-ipify,
is also included in the project libs.
Additionally, you need the gnustl_shared.so stl c++ libary and the FirebaseGameInteractor, which you should throw in
the android/jniLibs folder after the first sync/build. And you need to connect the project to firebase!
